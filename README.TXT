I have again partnered with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) to create a meningitis vaccine clinic event finder web application. Currently it has all the CDPH free locations and events. You will notice it is a slightly altered version of the 'flushots2013' code. Well, I had to make this thing work in two days. So that's what you get. Public health emergencies are like that sometimes.

I created this as a volunteer effort. The code that runs it is open, completely free, and reusable by anyone.

Special thanks to Smart Chicago for hosting this thing. Also thanks to Raed Mansour and  Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita (both with CDPH) for being great to work with. Chicago, you don't know how lucky you are to have these two working for you.
